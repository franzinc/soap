   SOAPAction header is now conformant - earlier version failed 
    to place string quotes around the value.
   XMLDecl is now (correctly) optional - earlier versions 
    signalled an error if this item was absent in the SOAP 
    message.
   Many SOAP examples were pointing to obsolete web services.
    These examples are now deleted or commented out.
